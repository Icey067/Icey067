### Hey there, I'm Aaditya 👋

I'm a **Machine Learning & Android Developer** based in India, passionate about building intelligent and user-friendly applications.

* 🧠 **On the ML side:** I'm experienced with Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, building models like the `Cat-Dog-Image-Classifier` you can see in my pins.
* 📱 **On the mobile side:** I build modern, native apps using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, like my `Android-Notes-App` and `Minesweeper` game.
* 🚀 **I'm currently** learning more and am open to new opportunities and collaborations.
