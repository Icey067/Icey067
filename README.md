### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25px">

I'm Aaditya, a **Software Developer** based in India.

* 🧠 **Machine Learning:** I have experience with Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, building models like the [Cat-Dog-Image-Classifier](https://github.com/Icey067/Cat-Dog-Image-Classifier) & [Focus-Monitor](https://github.com/Icey067/Focus-Monitor).

* 📱 **Software Development:** I build modern, native apps using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, like my [Android-Notes-App](https://github.com/Icey067/Android-Notes-App), [Minesweeper](https://github.com/Icey067/Minesweeper-Android-App), and [Fullstack-Weather-App](https://github.com/Icey067/Fullstack-Weather-App).

* 💻 **Full-Stack Development:** I enjoy creating responsive web apps using the MERN stack (React, Node.js) like [InspireX](https://github.com/Icey067/InspireX), a random quote generator.
  
* 🤝 **Open Source Contributions:** I enjoy collaborating on projects like [Grin-Retro-Game](https://github.com/Icey067/Grin-Retro-Game), [Hover-sandwich](https://github.com/Icey067/hover-sandwich), [Brave-Browser](https://github.com/Icey067/brave-browser.git).
